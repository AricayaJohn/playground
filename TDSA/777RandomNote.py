#syntaxERror 
    #-> means that there is something wrong with the way your program is writen -- puntuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or missing parenthesis can all trigger a syntax err


#NameError 
    #-> A NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a NameError.
