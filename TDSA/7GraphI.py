#graphs
#collection of nodes + edges

# directed graphs 
# - with arrow heads

#udirected graphs 
# -without arrow heads

#neigbor nodes
#is a node accessible to a node by edge

#adjecency list -used to explain a graph


#has path
#Write a function, has_path, that takes in a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a directed acyclic graph and two nodes(src, dst). The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a directed path between the source and destination nodes.

#acyclic = no cycles
#cycle = can return to original node
